Working with workspaces
=======================
After you have successfully logged in, the application presents available workspaces you are per-mitted to work with.

-	Workspaces are spaces on the EOf Insight’s cloud provided to users for storing their work including datasets, charts, dashboards…
-	The user who creates a workspace is called the owner of the workspace.
-	The owner have all the rights on her workspace including viewing and editing.
-	A user having permission on a workspace can share it to other users and set permission for each one.

If it is the first time you access EOf Insight, no workspace is available. You can create a work-space by clicking « Create New » in the « Workspaces » screen.
